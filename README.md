# AI-GLASS-FOR-BLIND-ASSISTANCE

**ABSTRACT:** 

Blind and visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in their daily lives, particularly in navigating unfamiliar environments, identifying people, and performing essential tasks independently.  
Our project aims to develop an AI-powered assistive device that integrates facial recognition, currency identification, and voice command features to enhance independence for visually impaired individuals. The system accurately identifies and announces familiar faces, recognizes different currency denominations, and enables voice-controlled SMS messaging and music playback. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning, the solution ensures real-time performance and accessibility. Designed to be compact and wearable, our device provides a seamless, hands-free experience, empowering users with greater confidence, safety, and autonomy in their daily lives. 

**FEATURES:**

• Facial Recognition: Identifies and announces familiar faces to assist in social interactions. 

• Currency Identification: Detects and announces different currency denominations for easier financial transactions. 

• Voice Command Integration: Allows users to send SMS messages and play music using voice commands. 

**APPLICATIONS:** 

• Assistive Technology for Visually Impaired Individuals 

• Financial Accessibility  

• Smart Wearable Devices
